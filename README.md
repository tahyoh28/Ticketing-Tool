**Ticekting Tool**

📘 Background
The company's current (AS-IS) support process relies on clients reaching out via email or phone to report issues or make requests. This method lacks a centralized repository and proper tracking, making it difficult to monitor whether issues have been resolved or requests fulfilled. Therefore, there is a need for a system where the entire company can monitor tickets and corresponding solutions in a structured way.

🎯 Objectives
Develop a support system where internal and external clients can raise issues and requests via a ticketing tool.

Enable organization-wide visibility into raised tickets and corresponding solutions.

Implement a ticketing system that enforces the SLA agreements in place with clients.

📌 Scope
The ticketing system will serve both external clients and internal employees.

For external clients, particularly those involved in BPM projects, tickets may include:

Issues with automated processes.

Requests for process enhancements.

For internal employees, tickets may include:

Hardware issues (e.g., PC or laptop malfunctions).

Software installation or IT service requests.

The system will contribute to:

Improved customer satisfaction.

Timely project delivery, as team members have no dependencies.

Efficient use of a team already experienced with ticketing systems.

Limitations:

Email is the only notification method; calls are not part of the communication process.

Email delays may occur due to internet issues or unread messages.

Customer interactions:

Customers receive email notifications.

Customers rate their experience and provide comments.

If unresolved issues are mentioned in comments, the Customer Service Unit reopens the ticket.

Tickets are closed upon customer confirmation.
